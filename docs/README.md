### About me

I am currently working as an explosives safety engineer for the U.S. Navy.  I have a science and civil engineering background.  I am getting back into coding.  It has been more than 10 years since my first exposure to coding in Python.  I have some experience with basic coding while "ricing" my various Linux configurations over the years.  
#### Education

- B.S. Physical Sciences, University of Maryland 
- B.S. Civil Engineering Technology, Old Dominion University

### Projects & Interests

#### qdmap

This is a QGIS plugin I would like to develop with Python for creating explosives safety site plans.

#### Emacs 

I don't actually contribute code to Emacs.  I just like using it and configuring it, specifically Doom Emacs for general writing and note taking.  I like to use the vim keybindings, and I love the lightweight functionality of it.

#### Linux
Favorite distros:
- Arch Linux
- KDE Neon
- Linux Mint
- Manjaro
