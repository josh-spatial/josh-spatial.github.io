## About me

I am currently working as an explosives safety engineer for the U.S. Navy.  I have a science and civil engineering background.  I am getting back into coding.  It has been more than 10 years since my first exposure to coding in Python.  I have some experience with basic coding while "ricing" my various Linux configurations over the years.  
### Education

- B.S. Physical Sciences, University of Maryland 
- B.S. Civil Engineering Technology, Old Dominion University

## Projects

### qdmap

This is a QGIS plugin I would like to develop with Python for creating explosives safety site plans.
